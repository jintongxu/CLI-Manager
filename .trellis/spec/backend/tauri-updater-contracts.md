# Tauri Updater Contracts

> Executable contracts for CLI-Manager's Tauri 2 auto-update pipeline across React, Tauri config/capabilities, GitHub Actions release artifacts, and installer restart UX.

## Scenario: Portable build checks updates without installing

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing distribution detection, updater store branching, About-page update actions, Windows portable packaging, or release asset publishing.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type AppDistribution = "standalone" | "portable" | "aur";
```

```rust
get_app_version() -> AppVersion // distribution = standalone | portable | aur
```

- Packaging entry: `scripts/package-portable.ps1 -Version <semver> -SourceDir <release> -OutputDir <dir>`.

### 3. Contracts

- Portable builds still call the signed Tauri updater `check()` API and may show version/date/release notes.
- Portable builds never call `Update.download()`, `Update.install()`, or `relaunch()` from the updater flow. Their primary action opens the matching GitHub Release page for manual ZIP replacement.
- Standalone and AUR behavior stays unchanged: standalone downloads/installs/relaunches; AUR skips updater operations and opens the AUR package page.
- The Windows x64 ZIP contains one `CLI-Manager/` root with `cli-manager.exe`, `cli-manager-codex-proxy.exe`, `cli-manager-daemon.exe`, `cli-manager-web-daemon.exe`, `portable.flag`, `resources/`, and `apps/web/dist/` (including `index.html` and `assets/`). It must not contain an installer or a user `data-root.json`.
- Validate all four executables and the Web entry as files, and `resources/` and Web `assets/` as directories before replacing existing output. Web resources live beside `resources/`, not inside it; preserve the runtime's `apps/web/dist` path.
- The portable ZIP is uploaded to the same draft GitHub Release but is not referenced from `latest.json`; Tauri installer selection must continue using signed installer artifacts only.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Portable update is available | Show “Download Portable Build” and open the version Release page. |
| Portable check fails | Show the normal signed-manifest error and keep the Release fallback. |
| Portable action is invoked through `downloadUpdate()` defensively | Return `false`; do not download an installer. |
| Required executable/resources missing during packaging | Fail the PowerShell script and release job. |
| Portable artifact missing from the draft release | Fail release asset verification before publishing. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: portable V1.3.5 detects V1.3.6, displays notes, and opens the V1.3.6 Release without starting MSI/NSIS.
- Base: standalone continues the existing signed download/install/relaunch flow.
- Bad: treating portable as standalone after version detection and calling the installer.
- Bad: placing `data-root.json` in the ZIP, which would overwrite a user's portable custom-root pointer on upgrade.

### 6. Tests Required

- Type-check updater distribution branches with `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Run the portable packaging script against a release directory and inspect ZIP entries.
- Verify ZIP layout/content and rejection of missing inputs before existing output is changed.
- Release workflow verification must require `CLI-Manager-V<version>-Windows-x64-portable.zip` before publishing.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
if (distribution !== "aur") await update.download();
```

#### Correct

```ts
if (distribution !== "standalone") return false;
await update.download();
```

## Scenario: Official Tauri updater release and install flow

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes touching update checks, update downloads/install, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`, updater/process plugins, or release workflow signing env.
- This is a cross-layer contract because the frontend calls Tauri plugin APIs, the WebView capability grants updater/restart permissions, Tauri config defines signed update endpoints, and GitHub Actions must publish matching `latest.json` / signature artifacts.
- Do not use the GitHub Releases REST API as the actual auto-update mechanism. GitHub Releases may only be used as a manual fallback link.

### 2. Signatures

Frontend update store surface:

```ts
interface UpdateState {
  currentVersion: string | null;
  checking: boolean;
  updateAvailable: boolean;
  updateInfo: UpdateInfo | null;
  pendingUpdate: Update | null;
  downloading: boolean;
  downloadProgress: number;
  downloadTotalBytes: number | null;
  downloadedBytes: number;
  readyToInstall: boolean;
  installing: boolean;
  lastCheckedAt: string | null;
  error: string | null;
  releaseFallbackUrl: string;
  fetchVersion(): Promise<void>;
  checkUpdate(options?: { silent?: boolean }): Promise<UpdateInfo | null>;
  downloadUpdate(): Promise<boolean>;
  installAndRelaunch(): Promise<void>;
  reset(): void;
}
```

Tauri updater APIs used by frontend:

```ts
import { check, type Update } from "@tauri-apps/plugin-updater";
import { relaunch } from "@tauri-apps/plugin-process";

const update = await check();
await update.download((event) => { /* progress */ });
await update.install();
await relaunch();
```

Rust plugin registration:

```rust
.plugin(tauri_plugin_updater::Builder::new().build())
.plugin(tauri_plugin_process::init())
```

### 3. Contracts

#### Tauri config

`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` must include:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "createUpdaterArtifacts": true
  },
  "plugins": {
    "updater": {
      "pubkey": "<Tauri updater public key content>",
      "endpoints": ["https://github.com/jintongxu/CLI-Manager/releases/latest/download/latest.json"],
      "windows": {
        "installMode": "passive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `pubkey` is public and may be committed.
- The matching private key must never be committed.
- Production endpoints must be HTTPS.
- Windows updater asset strategy is default/MSI; do not set `updaterJsonPreferNsis` unless the installer strategy is intentionally changed.

#### Capability / permissions

`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` must grant only:

```json
"updater:default",
"process:allow-restart"
```

- Do not grant `process:default` for updater UI.
- Do not add file-system permissions for updater downloads; Tauri updater owns that flow.

#### Release workflow env

`.github/workflows/release.yml` must pass secrets to `tauri-apps/tauri-action`:

```yaml
env:
  TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY }}
  TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD }}
with:
  includeUpdaterJson: true
```

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is required for releases that should auto-update.
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` is optional and required only when the signing key was generated with a password.
- The first version that includes updater support still requires manual installation; earlier releases without `latest.json` / `.sig` cannot be consumed by the official updater.

R2-backed releases use one repository variable as the build-time source of truth:

```text
R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://downloads.example.com
  -> TAURI_CONFIG.plugins.updater.endpoints[0]
  -> VITE_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
  -> CLI_MANAGER_R2_AGENT_MANIFEST_URL
  -> rendered install-ssh-agent.sh R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
```

- `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is required in release workflows and must be an HTTPS origin only: no credentials, path, query, or fragment. A trailing slash is normalized away.
- `.github/scripts/r2-release-config.mjs` owns validation and derivation. Workflows must not duplicate an exact production hostname check.
- `TAURI_CONFIG` overrides only updater endpoints during CI builds. The committed updater public key remains static in `tauri.conf.json` and must never come from an Actions variable.
- `VITE_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and `CLI_MANAGER_R2_AGENT_MANIFEST_URL` are compile-time values. Local builds without them retain the committed compatibility origin.
- GitHub Release remains the second updater endpoint and SSH Agent fallback.

#### UX behavior

- Startup update check may run silently after startup readiness; failures must not interrupt first screen or terminal restore.
- Manual settings-page check may surface errors and retry actions.
- Download starts only after user clicks the download action.
- Install/relaunch requires explicit confirmation.
- If terminal sessions are active, the confirmation must show the active count and warn that tasks may be interrupted; the user may still confirm.
- Keep a Release-page fallback link for manifest/signature/network failures.
- AUR-managed installs (`get_app_version().distribution === "aur"`) must skip updater check/download/install and use the AUR package page as the fallback. Package-manager ownership takes precedence over the standalone updater UX.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| No update available | `checkUpdate` returns `null`, sets `lastCheckedAt`, clears stale update state. |
| Startup check fails | No toast/error interruption; current app continues normally. |
| Manual check fails | Show a stable, understandable error with retry and Release fallback. |
| `latest.json` missing or invalid | Treat as update-check failure; do not claim no update. |
| Signature validation fails | Treat as updater failure; do not install; keep Release fallback. |
| Download progress has `contentLength` | Show percentage and byte progress. |
| Download progress lacks total length | Show indeterminate/downloading state, not `NaN`. |
| Download fails midway | Keep current app usable; allow retry or reset. |
| Download finished | Set `readyToInstall`; do not install automatically. |
| Active terminal count > 0 | Show strong warning with count before install/relaunch. |
| User confirms install | Call `install()` then `relaunch()` only after confirmation. |
| User chooses later | Keep downloaded/pending state when safe; do not close resources during active download/install. |
| `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is missing | Fail the release before compiling or publishing artifacts. |
| R2 URL is HTTP or contains credentials/path/query/fragment | Fail validation; do not generate `TAURI_CONFIG` or release artifacts. |
| R2 URL ends with `/` | Normalize it to the origin before deriving endpoint and artifact URLs. |
| Local non-release build has no R2 variable | Use the committed compatibility origin; keep GitHub fallback. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: release workflow publishes signed updater artifacts; app startup silently detects a new version; settings page displays notes; user downloads; active terminal warning appears; user confirms install/relaunch.
- Base: GitHub latest release lacks updater JSON; manual check shows failure and the Release fallback link, while terminal sessions continue unaffected.
- Bad: checking `https://api.github.com/repos/.../releases/latest` and manually comparing `tag_name` for the auto-update path bypasses Tauri's signed updater contract.
- Bad: granting `process:default` just to relaunch the app expands permissions beyond the updater UI need.
- Good: changing the Repository Variable updates the next build's updater, Agent manifest, UI install command, and rendered installer together.
- Base: an already-installed older build continues using its embedded old origin; keep that origin available or redirect it.
- Bad: fetch an updater hostname from unsigned runtime configuration, or inject the updater public key from Actions variables.

### 6. Tests Required

- TypeScript checks:
  - `checkUpdate({ silent: true })` must not set user-visible `error` on failure.
  - Progress math must handle unknown `contentLength` without `NaN`.
  - `reset()` must close pending updater resources only when not downloading/installing.
- UI checks:
  - Settings page renders no-update, checking, update-available, downloading, ready-to-install, installing, and error states.
  - Active terminal warning includes the count when at least one non-exited/non-error terminal exists.
  - Install action is unavailable until download is finished and confirmation is visible.
- Backend/config checks:
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` parses and includes `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` plus updater endpoint/pubkey.
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` includes `updater:default` and `process:allow-restart`, not `process:default`.
  - `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passes after plugin changes.
- Release checks:
  - `r2-release-config.test.mjs` rejects missing/HTTP/credential/path/query/fragment values and asserts all derived env values.
  - Both release workflows run the shared configuration step before compilation and use the rendered installer.
  - GitHub Actions release has `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` available.
  - Published release includes `latest.json` and signature-backed updater artifacts.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/repos/jintongxu/CLI-Manager/releases/latest");
const latestVersion = (await response.json()).tag_name;
```

This can notify users, but it is not a signed installable update path.

#### Correct

```ts
const update = await check();
if (update) {
  await update.download(onDownloadEvent);
  await update.install();
  await relaunch();
}
```

#### Wrong: duplicate the current R2 hostname in workflow validation

```bash
test "$R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL" = "https://current-host.example.com"
```

#### Correct: validate once and derive every build-time consumer

```yaml
- name: Configure R2 release
  run: node .github/scripts/r2-release-config.mjs export-actions-env
```

#### Wrong

```json
"permissions": ["updater:default", "process:default"]
```

#### Correct

```json
"permissions": ["updater:default", "process:allow-restart"]
```

## Scenario: Bundle resources before direct Cargo release checks

### Root cause and contract

Direct Cargo commands invoke `src-tauri/build.rs` and validate `bundle.resources` before
Tauri can run `build.beforeBuildCommand`. The Windows release job must produce the Web
bundle and download/verify the signed SSH Agent files before either proxy check. A warm
checkout containing `apps/web/dist` does not prove this ordering is correct.

- Prepare resources in the invoking workflow; keep `build.rs` as a thin `tauri_build::build()` entry.
- Do not remove resource mappings, inject a synthetic `TAURI_CONFIG`, or allow checks to fail silently.
- Linux/macOS continue using Tauri's normal `beforeBuildCommand` to build the frontend and Web bundle.
- Both Windows checks must complete before the signed Tauri packaging step.

### Discovery list

- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml`: owns prerequisite ordering and failure propagation.
- [x] `apps/web/package.json` and the root `web:build` script: produce `dist/index.html` and `dist/assets`; commands unchanged.
- [x] `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: declares Web and SSH Agent bundle resources; mappings and signing configuration unchanged.
- [x] `src-tauri/build.rs`: validates those resources for direct Cargo builds as well as Tauri builds; unchanged.
- [x] `scripts/codexAppServerProxy.e2e.test.mjs`: builds the real proxy with Cargo and checks its behavior; assertions unchanged.
- [x] `scripts/tauri-cli.mjs` and `scripts/tauriCliDevProxy.test.mjs`: direct local Cargo/prebuild callers share the resource prerequisite; runtime wrapper unchanged.
- [x] `.github/scripts/release-workflow.test.mjs`: prevents resource producers from moving after Windows Cargo consumers.
- [x] PTY, IPC, window focus, split panes, WSL project paths and CLI Hooks: unrelated to build-host resource preparation.

### Scenario and validation matrix

| Scenario | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Fresh Windows checkout without `apps/web/dist` | Build real Web assets before invoking the proxy's Cargo build. |
| Warm Windows checkout | Rebuild Web assets; do not infer freshness from directory existence. |
| Missing/failed SSH Agent download | Fail resource verification before proxy tests and packaging. |
| Linux/macOS release | Keep normal Tauri frontend/Web preparation and signed bundle checks. |
| Direct local Cargo or Windows development prebuild | Prepare configured bundle resources first; the Cargo build script does not run npm. |
| Resource producer or Windows test fails | Fail the job; do not publish the draft release. |

Run `node .github/scripts/release-workflow.test.mjs` in release preparation. Verify that the
old workflow fails this guard, then run `npm run web:build`, `npm run test:codex-proxy:e2e`
and `npm run test:tauri-dev-proxy` from a clean Windows checkout with the required Agent resources.

## Scenario: Target-scoped Tauri configuration features

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or moving a Tauri Cargo feature whose enablement must match a platform-specific `tauri.*.conf.json` value, such as `macos-private-api` / `app.macOSPrivateApi`; or adding a Windows native sidecar consumed beside the debug executable during `npm run tauri dev`.

### 2. Signatures

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["tray-icon", "protocol-asset", "devtools"] }

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["macos-private-api"] }
```

```json
// src-tauri/tauri.macos.conf.json
{ "app": { "macOSPrivateApi": true } }
```

```text
# scripts/tauri-cli.mjs, Windows `tauri dev` only
cargo build --locked --no-default-features --manifest-path <repo>/src-tauri/Cargo.toml \
  --bin cli-manager --bin cli-manager-codex-proxy [--target <triple>] [--release] \
  [--profile <name>] [--target-dir <path>]
```

### 3. Contracts

- Configuration-sensitive Tauri features must be declared under the same Cargo target that owns the corresponding platform config.
- Windows and Linux direct Cargo commands must not activate `macos-private-api`.
- macOS builds must activate `macos-private-api` and keep `app.macOSPrivateApi = true`.
- Tests must exercise the real Cargo invocation; do not inject a synthetic `TAURI_CONFIG` merely to suppress the consistency error.
- On Windows, the `scripts/tauri-cli.mjs` `dev` entrypoint must build `cli-manager` and `cli-manager-codex-proxy` before spawning Tauri. The proxy is required because remote Codex handoff resolves `current_exe().with_file_name("cli-manager-codex-proxy.exe")`; selecting both binaries in one Cargo invocation lets the shared library build graph be reused.
- The proxy prebuild must use the same `--no-default-features` development feature selection as Tauri's Cargo invocation, in addition to forwarding explicit feature selection arguments when supplied.
- The proxy prebuild must mirror the `TAURI_CONFIG` JSON merge value generated by the selected `--config`/`-c` extension so `tauri-build` sees the same Cargo fingerprint input before Tauri starts.
- The prebuild must forward both `--target <triple>` / `--target=<triple>` and `-t <triple>` / `-t=<triple>` as Cargo's `--target <triple>`.
- Tauri's first `--` starts Cargo runner arguments; only the second `--` starts application arguments. The prebuild must inspect Tauri options and runner arguments, forward `--release`, `--profile`, and `--target-dir`, and ignore everything after the second boundary.
- A failed or unavailable Cargo prebuild must return a non-zero exit and must not start Tauri. Non-Windows platforms and non-`dev` Tauri commands must not run this prebuild.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `macos-private-api` is in common dependencies | Reject: Windows/Linux direct Cargo builds can fail Tauri feature/config consistency checks. |
| macOS target feature is missing | Reject: macOS transparent/private-API window behavior loses its required Cargo capability. |
| macOS feature exists but `macOSPrivateApi` is false/missing | Reject through the existing macOS window-controls verification. |
| Common and target dependency declarations are correctly split | Windows/Linux resolve only common features; macOS additionally resolves `macos-private-api`. |
| Windows `tauri dev` without a target | Build the main binary and proxy into Cargo's default debug target before Tauri starts, including the selected `TAURI_CONFIG` fingerprint input. |
| Windows `tauri dev` with either target syntax | Build both selected binaries for the same target triple before Tauri starts. |
| Windows `tauri dev --release` | Build both selected binaries in the release profile before Tauri starts. |
| Windows runner arguments select `--profile`, `--target-dir` or features | Forward the selection to the proxy Cargo build. |
| Application arguments after the second `--` resemble Cargo options | Ignore them when selecting the proxy build target/profile/directory. |
| Windows proxy Cargo build fails | Return Cargo's non-zero result and do not invoke Tauri. |
| Non-Windows or a non-`dev` Tauri command | Do not build the Windows proxy. |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: Windows Codex proxy E2E calls `cargo build --locked` directly and succeeds without platform-config overrides.
- Base: normal Tauri CLI builds continue merging the platform config and resolve the same target-specific feature set.
- Bad: set `TAURI_CONFIG` inside one test to claim success while the manifest still enables a macOS-only feature globally.
- Good: `npm run tauri dev -- --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` completes the main/proxy prebuild before launching the dev process, and a second unchanged launch lets Cargo reuse both artifacts.
- Bad: rely on Cargo's `default-run = "cli-manager"` and launch Tauri without compiling the separately consumed proxy binary.

### 6. Tests Required

- Inspect `cargo metadata --no-deps` and assert the common `tauri` dependency excludes `macos-private-api` while the macOS-target dependency includes it.
- Run `npm run test:codex-proxy:e2e` on Windows.
- Run `cargo check --locked --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- Run `node scripts/verify-macos-window-controls.mjs`.
- Run `npm run test:tauri-dev-proxy` on Windows. Assert Cargo runs before Tauri, both binaries and `--no-default-features` are selected, the `TAURI_CONFIG` merge value is mirrored for file and inline config, feature/target forwarding covers Tauri and runner long/short forms, release/profile/target-dir respect both `--` boundaries, Cargo failure prevents Tauri launch, and `build` does not prebuild the proxy.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["macos-private-api"] }
```

#### Correct

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["tray-icon", "protocol-asset", "devtools"] }

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["macos-private-api"] }
```

#### Wrong

```js
spawn("tauri", ["dev", ...args]);
```

#### Correct

```js
const proxyBuildCode = await buildWindowsDevProxy(tauriArgs);
if (proxyBuildCode !== 0) process.exitCode = proxyBuildCode;
else spawn("tauri", tauriArgs);
```
